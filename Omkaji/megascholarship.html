The award basically is for under-represented minority students who want to learn, communicate and develop the fundamentals in the field of Information Technology including software programming, data intelligence, web hosting, e-Commerce and enterprise software management.</p></blockquote>

<p><blockquote>The Scholarship course worth NRs. 150,000 is mainly targeted to qualified students mainly from a minority group, who are socially and financially unable to pursue higher education but have strong enthusiasm in making an IT career. The students of high school seniors or college freshman, sophomores, or juniors pursuing a college degree, college dropouts are eligible to apply.</p></blockquote>
<p><blockquote>In recent years the speed, flexibility and affordability of rapidly evolving Information technology has helped slowly shut the intellectual divide between the have and have-not and enabled tens of thousands of young people in Nepal. However, this effort is slow-paced and not adequate enough to fulfill the IT demands for next 10 years. We think sponsoring those have-not category students will at least fill some of the gap for those who have potential to have a professional career as well as serve back the society in meeting the challenges of the diverse work /environment.</p></blockquote><p><blockquote>
Mega Scholarship 2014 is mainly based on two categories; Need Based and Student Specific. The foundation of this Scholarship is need-based. In a poor country like Nepal where Opportunity favors those who have means and medium, we have possibly thousands of potential youth left behind just because of a single moment of a chance because of the countryâ€™s poor educational policy, deprived economic conditions or geographical isolation. Need- based student lies in this category that are from remote places of the country and has potential to build career in programming in future. All we do is providing them the ample knowledge and resources to build themselves a better future. However, student specific category explains those students who must initially qualify their representation based on unprivileged and minority race, gender and family background.</blockquote></td></tr>
